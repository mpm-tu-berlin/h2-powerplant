# Script to automatically download the BDEW data file from the specified URL, extract the required file, verify the checksum, and move it to the right location.
# TODO: If the checksum check on the file from bdew.de fails, the script should attempt to download the file from the archive.org URL as a fallback and check that checksum instead.
# TODO: (or, the user could be prompted to confirm if they want to proceed with the file from archive.org if the checksum fails / wants to proceed with the updated file)
